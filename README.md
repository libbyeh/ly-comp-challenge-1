# ly-comp-challenge-1

Libby Yeh's Static Comp-1 features "Glamour Chickens" inspired by the chickens that are co-residents at my current home. Whie caring for them, I have come to realize how intelligent and kind they are and so I wanted to feature them and change the narrative of what chickens are. Leveraging the Bradely Cooper comp and keeping with its integrity, Glamour Chicken" flexes its muscles taking liberty with the color pallete, fonts, text and icon-use.
